# Tensor-valued diffusion MRI of meningiomas for preopretive classification and consistency estimation
Code to the manuscript in prep: *Tensor-valued diffusion MRI of meningiomas: Relation to consistency, histological type, grade and conventional dMRI*.

Data accessibility: Available is code used to process raw data from the scanner in the folder Process. The summary of the output data is available in the folder data (images themselves not publicly available but are upon reasonable request). The published data is enough to produce distributions and histograms but not images).

Analyzed using MATLAB 2020a. Data processed and visualized by md-dmri: multidimensional toolbox available at: https://github.com/markus-nilsson/md-dmri (version published 27.Jan.2020). 

Plotting enabled by plotSpread (version updated 11.Feb 2017 available at: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37105-plot-spread-points-beeswarm-plot and in the folder Analysis/A_functions/Plotspread) and by Tight_plot (version updated 03.Mar.2016 available at: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27991-tight_subplot-nh-nw-gap-marg_h-marg_w and in the folder /Analysis/A_functions/tight_subplot)
